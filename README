Use ./run.sh to run everything
Some parameters will need adjusting

cm.txt should have x, y, vx, vy

This will
	1) Convert Ascii files to one velocity file per time
	2) Use velocity files to make one omega file per time
	3) Time averages 
	4) Produces images for each averaged time

Things to edit:
	Params in run.sh
	In vel_to_w.py, can change pass statements to resume calculation on second
		half of data
	In plot.py, need to adjust window settings
